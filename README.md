1.	Description
I created an extensible web-based workflow management system. 

2.	PURPOSE
The software helps users upload excel documents into a web-based system. The software then renders the excel
Documents into a graphical visualisations which produces more efficient, 
Faster reporting and promotes safer data analysis limiting human error when compiling data analysis reports. 

3.	FEATURES
The Software collects the user’s first name, last name and date of birth through a basic HTML form.
It has an upload button where the user can upload excel financial spreadsheets. 
The software then processes the data and renders the data into 
A graph.

The software interface is very easy for the user to understand and interact with. 
The graphical representation of the data is easily accessible on the front page.
 The user does not need to do any configuration, the operations are all running in the back end, 
Through extensible third party integration (Microsoft excel) that feel indistinguishable from the native 
Functionality.

4.	TECHNOLOGIES USED
The software is created in visual studio code and runs on xampp server and apache.
 It’s running on a local host. The software is able to upload excel files and has human input 
Through an html form where the user inserts first name, last name and date of birth.
 The excel document is a has financials for a year (income and expenses for 12 months) 
Once the user uploads the excel file is appears as a graph. 

This software is extensible as it can be upgraded to add new functionalities like,
 Loading the data generated from MySQL workbench (DATABASE) to create more focused 
And direct offerings to clients based on their data, it can be connected to 
Banking applications that help people track their spending, it can help organisations 
Allocate their budget wisely based on analysing the data

This software was created using PHP, which is a programming language 
That is used to develop web-based applications and work management systems.
The PHP language then connects to XAMPP- XAMPP is a web server that allows
 Programmers to write and test their code on a local webserver
